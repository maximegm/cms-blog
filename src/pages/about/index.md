### Some Background info

Originally from Paris but after moving across Europe before crossing the Atlantic, Maxime found himself in Boston for College and what eventually became a decade. The Endurance training came from working as a bike courier while studying and discovering a love for endurance and resilience.

### Camaraderie in Indivual Sports

There are many charicaturesd of the types of people you meet at any of these endurance and long-distance events. The harder and bigger the events, the moreincredible the people. I came for the racing and challenge but am always surprised by how helpful and supportive everyone is.

### Why the CA Central Coast?

Truth be told I love Chamonix and the Alps more than any other place I've visited or that is still on my list but after going through lockdown in Paris in 2020 I wanted to be close to family AND have a rich and diverse playground to explore in my backyard.

### Why Ultras?

After you've run the first marathon and know that you still have at least another one to run, your brain starts doing some fascinating things. Just make sure you don't get overly ambitious and that you're ready for the night or a snowstorm.
